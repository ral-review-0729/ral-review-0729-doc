ðŸ‘‹ Hello!

ðŸ¤– RBNAME is a low-cost mobile robotics platform. We hope to open-source all the hardware design and related code to lower the entry barrier in the field of Embodied AI, enabling more researchers and users to participate. The total cost of the RBNAME hardware is approximately $1000, with all components available for purchase on e-commerce platforms. (Depending on your computing requirements, you can choose to pair it with a separate computer, laptop, Raspberry Pi, or Orin, which may incur additional computing and powering costs.)

This series of tutorials will guide you in assembling your own RBNAME, using RoboPilot to control the robot in a fully remote environment, and utilizing the LeRobot program to collect data for training a fully autonomous robot policy.

RBNAME is an ongoing project, and **we are continuously adding more tutorials, so stay tuned!**
