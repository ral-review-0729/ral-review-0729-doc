üëã Hello!

ü§ñ AhaRobot is a low-cost mobile robotics platform. We hope to open-source all the hardware design and related code to lower the entry barrier in the field of Embodied AI, enabling more researchers and users to participate. The total cost of the AhaRobot hardware is approximately $1000, with all components available for purchase on e-commerce platforms. (Depending on your computing requirements, you can choose to pair it with a separate computer, laptop, Raspberry Pi, or Orin, which may incur additional computing and powering costs.)

This series of tutorials will guide you in assembling your own AhaRobot, using RoboPilot to control the robot in a fully remote environment, and utilizing the LeRobot program to collect data for training a fully autonomous robot policy.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è¬†AhaRobot's **Capabilities**

AhaRobot originated from my personal needs: I wanted to remotely control a robot at home to change 3D printer materials and locate items in cabinets. While using robots like Mobile Aloha, I found that they were unable to handle tasks with large up and down trips and were unable to recover from errors when items were dropped in a fully remote teleoperated environment.

In that section, I will outline the tasks that AhaRobot can help you with, as well as the tasks that are somewhat difficult for AhaRobot, to help you make an informed decision.

‚úÖ AhaRobot can help you:

1. Accomplish some simple but require a certain range of movement of the family tasks, such as: from the kitchen to help you get a glass of water, help you get food from the refrigerator
2. Perform some tasks that require up and down movement, e.g., find something in the cupboard, or help you feed your cat üê±.
3. Get your hands dirty in a complete robotics project, not only learning robotics from a book or playing with robots in a simulator. Master the fundamentals of motion control for robots, such as coordinate system transformations, inverse kinematics, and more.
4. Hands-on practice with some of the underlying control elements, such as CAN communication, PID control, FOC control (ODrive project), and understanding some of the common motion control techniques used in industrial robots, such as acceleration and deceleration planning.
5. Collect data, train, and deploy a fully autonomous robot policy.

ü§î AhaRobot will have some difficulty in accomplishing these tasks due to project goals as well as budget:

1. Very delicate manipulation tasks, such as threading ties, needlework, etc. Like the [SO-ARM/XLerobot](https://github.com/Vector-Wangel/XLeRobot) project, the motors we used are not suited for this type of task.
2. Tasks that require hand-eye calibration, AhaRobot does not ship with a strict calibration process; you need to do the calibration process yourself (in our TODO List)

‚ùå In addition, AhaRobot cannot:

1. Used in the medical field, since AhaRobot is not tested and certified for it.
2. Replace traditional industrial robots, which have higher manufactured precision gear sets (gear backlash, gear profile consistency, etc.), higher encoders (typically 16-20 bit), and a strict factory calibration process (zero point, linearity, etc.). If your method has stringent requirements for accuracy (absolute positional accuracy as well as relative positional accuracy), use an industrial-level robotic arm designed for this purpose.
3. Operating on non-planar terrain, such as steps, it is worth noting that AhaRobot still maintains a certain degree of terrain passability, for example, through elevator gaps.

AhaRobot is an ongoing project, and **we are continuously adding more tutorials, so stay tuned!**
